# Fraudulent-Job-Posting-Detection using PyTorch and BERT

This project uses BERT, PyTorch, and the Hugging Face Transformers library to develop a machine learning model for fraud detection in job postings using natural language processing. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled job postings, detecting fraudulent vs legitimate postings.

## Kaggle Competition Dataset

- Name: [Real or Fake] : Fake Job Description Prediction (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction)
- Description: This dataset contains 18K job descriptions out of which about 800 are fake. The data consists of both textual information and meta-information about the jobs. The dataset can be used to create classification models which can learn the job descriptions which are fraudulent.
